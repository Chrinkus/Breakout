#Breakout JS

There are three stages to this project:

1. Complete the MDN Breakout tutorial using pure JavaScript
2. Create a new file that achieves the same results as the tutorial using better patterns
3. Continue to abstract functionality into a reusable 2D game engine

Once these goals are met I will attempt to make a Space Invaders replica to see how verstile my engine is.
